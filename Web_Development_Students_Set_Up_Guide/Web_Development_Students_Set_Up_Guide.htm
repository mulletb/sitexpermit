    <h2>Forward</h2>
	 <p>When I started this course: I felt overwhelmed with the amount of accounts you needed to be logged into, and, the new student email that was forced upon me. "What is my new email?" "Why can't i use my regular email" "What is my password?" "Why doesn't anything work?!"
                    <br><br>                  
In reality: its actually fairly easy, and, it seems rather straightforward and basic once your already started. The problem was: it seemed difficult in the initial "chaos" of getting used to a new situation.<br><br>
 Hopefully: a plain step by step guide of the procedure from the basic beginning might help someone have a less stressful start.	</div>

    <h2>Your Student ID and the clock in</h2>
	       <br>
		   <h3>Knowing/acquiring your student ID</h3>
<br>		   
		   <p>Knowing your student ID is the first thing, so: start with that.
		  The course instructor will probably have the proper resources to get your student ID if you don't have it or know it already. <br></p>
		  
		  <p id="note">NOTE: if you came here straight from a Lee County high school, your old student ID and student email may work for some things, but, you should/will be issued a new ID number and subsequent email, and, that is the one you will need to be using.
		  </p>
		  </div>
		  <br>
		  <h3> Clocking In  </h3>
		  
		  <p> your clock in will simply be your student ID number. The default password should be the last four digits.   		  
		   <br>
		   </div><br>
	<h2>Your Student Email</h2>
	  <p>If you are here at your first day of web development, the school already made a separate  email account in your name in your absentia. <br>   <br>
	  You log in at <a href="https://mail.leeschools.net">https://mail.leeschools.net<a> , and your email is based on your student ID number. <br> The format uses your ID number as "f12345678@students.leeschools.net"  The default password should be your full 8 digit student ID.

	 <p id="note">  NOTE: Most of the sites you will need to log into for this course will need to use your student email to work properly.</p><br>

	 <p id="note">NOTE: again: its not a good idea to use your old high school email, which may be tempting since: there may be an issue/delay that causes your login not to work. Ask your instructor about these issues and try to maintain patience.
